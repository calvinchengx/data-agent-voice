"""Shields.io endpoint JSON, generated from what actually ran.

The docs site publishes these files; README.md reads them back through
shields.io. The number therefore comes from `docs/witnesses.json`, which
`scripts/witnesses.py` writes from a real `pytest` run and re-verifies in CI —
so a badge that disagrees with the suite fails the build rather than
advertising a number nobody proved.

A missing or unparseable manifest is an error here, not a zero: a badge
reading 0/0 looks like a project with no tests, which would be a lie of a
different shape.
